Ten of these inbreds (LH1, LH123HT, LH82, PH207, 4676A, PHG39, PHG47, PHG84, PHJ40, PHZ51) are proprietary inbreds that have expired from Plant Variety Protection (PVP) and represent the lineage of key heterotic germplasm pools used in present-day commercial corn hybrids. And two of them are predominant public inbreds, B73 and Mo17. (B) Phenotypic data were collected for anthesis-silking interval (ASI, in days), days to 50\% pollen shed (DTP), days to 50\% silking (DTS), ear height (EHT, in cm), grain yield adjusted to 15.5\% moisture (GY, in bu/A), plant height (PHT, in cm), and test weight (TW, in pounds). \relax }}{1}}

Of these sites, 506,898 (42\%) are evolutionary constraint; variants at these sites were considered as deleterious. (B) Mean GERP scores were calculated for each bin (bin size = 0.01) of minor allele frequency (MAF). The regression analysis indicated that variants at conserved sites tend to be maintained in a low frequency. Red line denotes regression line and grey lines define its 95\% confidence interval.\relax }}{1}}

Under the additive model, 2 x GERP score was assigned to the homozygous loci with non-reference SNP calls, 1 x GERP score was assigned to the heterozygous loci, and 0 was assigned to the homozygous loci with reference SNP calls. Under the dominant model, 1 x GERP score was assigned to both the homozygous loci with non-reference SNP calls and heterozygous loci, 0 was assigned to homozygous loci with reference SNP calls.\relax }}{1}}

Accuaries drived from the real data were plotted on the left side of the bean (blue) and accuracies derived from the circular shuffled data were plotted on the right side of the bean (grey). Horizotal bars on beans indicate the mean accuracies. Grey dashed line indicate overall average. Stars on top of the beans indicate significantly improved cross-validation accuracies. \relax }}{1}}

@article{Cooper2005,
abstract = {Comparisons of orthologous genomic DNA sequences can be used to characterize regions that have been subject to purifying selection and are enriched for functional elements. We here present the results of such an analysis on an alignment of sequences from 29 mammalian species. The alignment captures approximately 3.9 neutral substitutions per site and spans approximately 1.9 Mbp of the human genome. We identify constrained elements from 3 bp to over 1 kbp in length, covering approximately 5.5\% of the human locus. Our estimate for the total amount of nonexonic constraint experienced by this locus is roughly twice that for exonic constraint. Constrained elements tend to cluster, and we identify large constrained regions that correspond well with known functional elements. While constraint density inversely correlates with mobile element density, we also show the presence of unambiguously constrained elements overlapping mammalian ancestral repeats. In addition, we describe a number of elements in this region that have undergone intense purifying selection throughout mammalian evolution, and we show that these important elements are more numerous than previously thought. These results were obtained with Genomic Evolutionary Rate Profiling (GERP), a statistically rigorous and biologically transparent framework for constrained element identification. GERP identifies regions at high resolution that exhibit nucleotide substitution deficits, and measures these deficits as "rejected substitutions". Rejected substitutions reflect the intensity of past purifying selection and are used to rank and characterize constrained elements. We anticipate that GERP and the types of analyses it facilitates will provide further insights and improved annotation for the human genome as mammalian genome sequence data become richer.},

@article{Davydov2010,
abstract = {Computational efforts to identify functional elements within genomes leverage comparative sequence information by looking for regions that exhibit evidence of selective constraint. One way of detecting constrained elements is to follow a bottom-up approach by computing constraint scores for individual positions of a multiple alignment and then defining constrained elements as segments of contiguous, highly scoring nucleotide positions. Here we present GERP++, a new tool that uses maximum likelihood evolutionary rate estimation for position-specific scoring and, in contrast to previous bottom-up methods, a novel dynamic programming approach to subsequently define constrained elements. GERP++ evaluates a richer set of candidate element breakpoints and ranks them based on statistical significance, eliminating the need for biased heuristic extension techniques. Using GERP++ we identify over 1.3 million constrained elements spanning over 7\% of the human genome. We predict a higher fraction than earlier estimates largely due to the annotation of longer constrained elements, which improves one to one correspondence between predicted elements with known functional sequences. GERP++ is an efficient and effective tool to provide both nucleotide- and element-level constraint scores within deep multiple sequence alignments.},

abstract = {The complex genomes of many economically important crops present tremendous challenges to understand the genetic control of many quantitative traits with great importance in crop production, adaptation, and evolution. Advances in genomic technology need to be integrated with strategic genetic design and novel perspectives to break new ground. Complementary to individual-gene-targeted research, which remains challenging, a global assessment of the genomic distribution of trait-associated SNPs (TASs) discovered from genome scans of quantitative traits can provide insights into the genetic architecture and contribute to the design of future studies. Here we report the first systematic tabulation of the relative contribution of different genomic regions to quantitative trait variation in maize. We found that TASs were enriched in the nongenic regions, particularly within a 5-kb window upstream of genes, which highlights the importance of polymorphisms regulating gene expression in shaping the natural variation. Consistent with these findings, TASs collectively explained 44\%-59\% of the total phenotypic variation across maize quantitative traits, and on average, 79\% of the explained variation could be attributed to TASs located in genes or within 5 kb upstream of genes, which together comprise only 13\% of the genome. Our findings suggest that efficient, cost-effective genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in species with complex genomes can focus on genic and promoter regions.},

    abstract = {<p>Several studies have shown that global crop production needs to double by 2050 to meet the projected demands from rising population, diet shifts, and increasing biofuels consumption. Boosting crop yields to meet these rising demands, rather than clearing more land for agriculture has been highlighted as a preferred solution to meet this goal. However, we first need to understand how crop yields are changing globally, and whether we are on track to double production by 2050. Using ‚àº2.5 million agricultural statistics, collected for ‚àº13,500 political units across the world, we track four key global crops‚Äîmaize, rice, wheat, and soybean‚Äîthat currently produce nearly two-thirds of global agricultural calories. We find that yields in these top four crops are increasing at 1.6%, 1.0%, 0.9%, and 1.3% per year, non-compounding rates, respectively, which is less than the 2.4% per year rate required to double global production by 2050. At these rates global production in these crops would increase by ‚àº67%, ‚àº42%, ‚àº38%, and ‚àº55%, respectively, which is far below what is needed to meet projected demands in 2050. We present detailed maps to identify where rates must be increased to boost crop production and meet rising demands.</p>},

@article{Burton2013,
abstract = {We characterized phenotypic variation for root traits in 256 Zea spp. accessions, including maize landraces and Z. mays L. subsp. huehuetenangensis (H. H. Iltis \& Doebley) Doebley, subsp. mexicana (Schrad.) H. H. Iltis, and subsp. parviglumis H. H. Iltis \& Doebley, Z. nicaraguensis H. H. Iltis \& B. F. Benz, Z. perennis (Hitchc.) Reeves \& Mangelsd., and Z. luxurians (Durieu \& Asch.) R. M. Bird. Anatomical traits included areas of the cross-section, stele, cortex, aerenchyma, and xylem and number of cortical cells and cell files. Architectural traits included diameters of the nodal root system, individual crown roots, and the stem; numbers of seminal and nodal roots; biomass; and nodal root length and branching. Ranges for anatomical traits were similar for teosintes and landraces, except for aerenchyma and xylem areas, and number of cortical cells. Landraces had greater variation for architectural traits except for nodal root number and branching, and had larger mean stele and xylem areas, longer nodal roots, wider nodal systems, and more seminal roots than teosintes. In contrast, teosintes were smaller but had more nodal roots with greater branching. At a common plant size, teosintes would have lower mean values for all anatomical traits, except for number of cortical cells and cell files. Teosintes had greater scaled values for all architectural traits except average root diameter. Cluster analysis divided accessions into eight root phenotypes. Phenotypic diversity for root traits in the genus Zea could be a valuable resource for improving stress tolerance in maize.},

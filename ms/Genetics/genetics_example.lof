\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1}{\ignorespaces Figures from simulations like those in \citeN {Rannalaetal2000} for the case $\lambda = 2$. ``R" indicates the estimator from \citeANP {Rannalaetal2000}\ ``P" denotes the partial sample MLE (Equations\nobreakspace {}6\hbox {} and\nobreakspace {}7\hbox {}), and ``C" denotes the complete sample MLE (Equations\nobreakspace {}8\hbox {} and\nobreakspace {}9\hbox {}). We show results for just one sample size, $n=100$ infected hosts. For the ``C" estimates, the additional uninfected hosts are used in the estimation. (a) Mean values of the estimates for $\lambda $ from data on a three allele locus with $p_2 = p_3 = .5(1-p_1)$ based on 50,000 simulated replicates. The ``R" estimator consistently overestimates $\lambda $, while both the partial and complete sample estimators estimate $\lambda $ well (though the partial sample MLE tends to overestimate $\lambda $ when the allele frequencies are highly uneven). (b) Percent standardized bias for the estimate of $p_1$ in the three allele locus described above. The arching curve is the same found in Figure\nobreakspace {}1 of \citeN {Rannalaetal2000}. The other two curves show that the estimators we propose estimate $\mathbf {p}$ with very little bias.}}{11}
